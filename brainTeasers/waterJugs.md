You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.
Fill up the five quart jug with water from the three quart jug. Then fill up the three quart jug again.  Add water from the three quart jug until you completely fill up the five quart jug.  Now dump out the five quart jug and add the quart left over from the three quart jug.  Finally fill up the three quart jug again and add it to the one quart within the five quart jug.
