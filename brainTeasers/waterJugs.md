You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

//5 Quart         //3 Quart

need: 4 quarts.

**///////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\**

I would fill up the 5 quart jug fully. Pour our 3 quarts into the 3 quart jug- take the remaining 2 quarts and put into the 4 quart jug.

I would then rinse and repeat. I would fully empty the 3 quart jug. 

Fill the 5 quart jug again- pour 3 quarts into 3qt jug and fill the rest of the four quart jug with the remaining two quarts.
