You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible. 

Fill 3 quart jug and transfer it over to the five quart jug. 
fill remaning quarts till 5 jug is all full 
have the remaning 1 quart in 3 jug with a filled 5 quart jug.
