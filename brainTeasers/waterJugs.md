You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


    5 quart jug    |   3 quart jug
    --------------------------------
    0               |   3             fill up 3 quart jug
    3               |   0             transfer 3 quarts to the 5 quart jug
    3               |   3             fill up 3 quart jug again
    5               |   1             fill up the 5 quart jug from the 3 quart jug with 1 quart remaining in the 3 quart jug
    0               |   1             empty the 5 quart jug
    1               |   0             transfer 1 quart from the 3 quart jug to the 5 quart jug
    1               |   3             fill up the 3 quart jug
    4               |   0             transfer the 3 quart jug to the 5 quart jug to get the desired 4 quarts of water
