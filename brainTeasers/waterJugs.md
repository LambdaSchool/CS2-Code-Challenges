You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.
Fill the three-quart jug, pour it into the five-quart jug. Then fill the three-quart jug again and fill the five-quart jug until it is full (leaving one-quart left in the three-quart jug). Throw away the five-quart jug, then pour your remaining one-quart into the five-quart jug, then fill the three-quart jug and add it to the one-quart in the three-quart jug.
