You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

# fill the 3 quart jug

# pour the 3 quarts into the 5 quart jug

# flll the 3 quart jug 

# fill the remainder of the 5 quart jug, leaving 1 quart in the 3 quart jug

# empty the 5 quart jug

# pour the remaining 1 quart from the 3 quart jug into the 5 quart jug

# fill the 3 quart jug

# pour the 3 quarts into the 5 quart jug

# the 5 quart jug now contains 4 quarts
