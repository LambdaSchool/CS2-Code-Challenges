You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1) Fill up 3 quart jug
2) Use the now full 3 quart jug to fill the 5 quart jug, twice
3) Now you're left with 1 quart in the 3 quart jug
4) Empty the 5 quart jug
5) Transfer that 1 quart of water from the 3 qt jug into the now empty 5 quart jug
6) Fill up the 3 quart jug again
7) Dump it into the 5 quart
8) You now have 4 quarts in the 5 qt jug
