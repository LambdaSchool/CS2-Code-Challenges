You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

fill 5 quart jar
move 5 quart jar water to 3 quart, now 5 quart jar has 2 quarts water in it.
remove all the water from 3 quart jar, and move the 2 quart water from the 5 quart jar to 3 quart jar, now the 3 quart jar has 2 quarts water in it.
fill the 5 quart jar, and use the 5 quart jar to fill the 3 quart jar which already have 2 quarts water in it. Then what was left in the 5 quart jar will be 4 quarts of water
