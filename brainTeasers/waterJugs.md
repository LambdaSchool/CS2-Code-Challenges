You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

5 qt
3 qt

=> 4 qt

find out where 3 qt mark is on 5 qt jug, which will
let us know where 2 qts is

fill 3 qt jug
xfer 3 qt water to 5 qt jug
mark 3 qt point on 5 qt jug
fill 5 qt jug
xfer water up to 3 qt mark to 3qt jug (2 qt)
mark 2 qt point on 3 qt jug
empty 5 qt jug
xfer 2 qt of water from 3 qt jug to 5 qt jug
pour 2 qt of water to 3 qt jug
xfer 2 qt of water from 3 qt jug to 5 qt jug
