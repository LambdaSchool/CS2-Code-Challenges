You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


fill up the 5 quart jug with water and then fill the 3 quart jug just to the top. The 5 quart jug will be left with 2 quarts. Put the 2 quarts aside and repeat again. Add 2 and 2 together to get 4 quarts. 

or 

fill the 5 quarts with 3 quarts. repeat but leave 1 quart in the 3 quart jug. empty the 5 quart jug and fill it with the 1 quart of water. fill up the 3 quart jug and add it to the 1 quart to get 4 quarts.
