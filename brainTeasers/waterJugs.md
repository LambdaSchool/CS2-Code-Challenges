You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1.Fill up the 5 quart jug with the 3 quart jug twice
2.You will have exactly 1 quart left on the second fill
3.Empty the 5 quart jug
4.Use the 1 quart left to measure the 4 quarts
   and fill the 5 quart jug with 4 quarts
