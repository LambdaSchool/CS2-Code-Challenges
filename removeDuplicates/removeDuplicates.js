/*
 * Write a function that takes an array and removes all duplicate items.

 * 
 * beast mode: try not to use two for loops. 
 *  hint: most array methods native to JS iterate in some way. 
 *  So if you're using 'indexOf' 'sort' 'forEach' etc, 
 *  you're more than likely using a for loop under the hood.
